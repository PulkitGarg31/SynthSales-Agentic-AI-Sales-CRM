"""Autonomous reply handlers.

Invoked by reply_classifier ONLY when the user has autonomous_replies on and the
safety gates pass (see the spec). Each handler composes a real outbound email,
sends it, and updates thread/contact state. Reuses the AI, meeting, and email
providers. Never bypasses the gates; callers wrap handle() in try/except and fall
back to surfacing on any error.
